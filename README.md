See `MANUAL.md` for the user's manual.

## Design Roadmap

- [ ] Display graphs of RPM, Gyros, Throttle, and Steering
- [ ] User actual serial data instead of random data
- [ ] Add start/stop display button
- [ ] Add serial port selection dialog
- [ ] Add option to flip analog port assignments
- [ ] Add options to change serial port configs
